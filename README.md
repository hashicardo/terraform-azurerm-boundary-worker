# Azure Worker Ingress
This infrastructure deploys the necessary infrastructure and configuration for an Ingress worker in Azure.

The reason why I call this an ingress worker is because it creates a public IP for the VM where it will be running and it should be deployed inside a public network. I.e. a network that can accept connections to this IP from anywhere on the internet.

This will satisfy the condition that basically any client can access it from the internet.

## What This Module Creates

- **Azure Linux VM** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) with Boundary Enterprise worker installed
- **Public IP address** (Static) for external client access
- **Network Interface** with both public and private IP configurations
- **Network Security Group** with rules for:
  - Inbound: SSH (22), Boundary proxy (9202, 9203)
  - Outbound: Boundary controller (9201), internet access
- **HCP Boundary Worker** registration with controller-generated activation token
- **SSH Key Pair** (TLS-generated) for VM access

## Public Network Requirements
- This module creates a security group to allow inbound connections on ports 9202 and 9203 as well as outbound on 9201 for connecting to the controller and for updates and internet connection in general.
- (WIP) This security group should also allow connection to Vault for credential retrieval (credential injection).

## Prerequisites

- Existing Azure Resource Group
- Existing Virtual Network (VNet)
- Existing Public Subnet
- HCP Boundary cluster with admin credentials
- Azure authentication credentials set via environment variables:
  ```bash
  export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
  export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
  export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your-subscription-id>
  export ARM_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
  ```

## Usage

1. Copy the example variables file:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```

2. Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your values:
   - Azure region and resource identifiers
   - HCP Boundary cluster URL and credentials
   - VM configuration (size, admin username)
   - Landing zone name for worker tagging

3. Initialize and apply:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Worker Configuration

The worker is configured with the following properties:
- **Type**: `ingress`
- **Purpose**: Accept connections from external clients
- **Tags**: Automatically tagged with `type`, `cloud`, `region`, and `lz_name`
- **Version**: Boundary Enterprise (configurable, default 0.20.0)
- **Authentication**: Controller-generated PKI token
- **Public Address**: Uses the VM's public IP for client connectivity

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `public_vm_name` | Name of the public VM |
| `public_vm_public_ip` | Public IP address of the public VM |

- `boundary-worker.tf` - HCP Boundary worker resource and cloudinit configuration
- `public-vm.tf` - Azure VM, network interface, and public IP resources
- `networking-data.tf` - Data sources for existing network resources and NSG configuration
- `variables.tf` - Input variable definitions
- `outputs.tf` - Output value definitions

## Notes

- The VM is automatically replaced when the Boundary worker resource is replaced
- SSH key pair is generated by Terraform and stored in state (retrieve via outputs)
- Worker registers with HCP Boundary using a controller-generated activation token
- Cloud-init logs are available at `/var/log/cloud-init-worker.log` on the VM
- Boundary service runs as a systemd service and can be managed with `systemctl`
